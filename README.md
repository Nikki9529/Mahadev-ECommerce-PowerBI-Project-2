Objective:

The owner of Madhav E-Commerce Stores wants us to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India.

Data Analysis Steps:

1. Import data into PowerBI and clean the data for errors.
2. Using Power Query for transforming data
3. Dashboard creation: Identifying the KPIs, and creating several visuals.
4. DAX Queries and Data Analysis: Created a few necessary columns in the data set to analyze the data more efficiently.
5. Added a few Slicers for a better and easy understanding of the data.


Few Insights from the Analysis (As per Me):

1. The profit for the Company has occurred the most in the 1st Quarter(Jan, Feb, March). In the month of November, the Company made its highest profit of nearly 10000. So, the Company needs to target more sales in the month of November and in the 1st Quarters.
2. The Company needs to increase its profit by promoting its Sales by offering discounts, offers, and coupons in the 2nd and 3rd Quarters since its making losses in those quarters.
3. Customers are usually preferring the Cash on Delivery option followed by UPI and Debit Card. So, the Company needs to offer more products for the COD Mode of Payment.
4. The top 3 States with the most Sales are Maharashtra, Madya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, so the Company needs to target more of these regions by providing offers and discounts. The company also needs to target other regions in order to expand its reach.
5. The top 3 Customers by Sales are Harivansh, Madhav and Madan Mohan, the Company needs to identify its potential customers and offer some customer loyalty programs for them.
6. If we look into the Category where the most sales occurred we can see that around 63% of the share is captured by Clothing.


Learning: 
1. Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
2. Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers.
3. Created connections, join new tables, and calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations.
4. Used different types of customized visualization.
